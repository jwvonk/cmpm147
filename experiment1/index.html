          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            I want the audience to read these patch notes and laugh about a&rpar; how
            absurd the implied pre-existing "bug" that the patch-note describes
            is, and b&rpar; how strange it would be to be the person whose job it is
            to "fix" the bug. Then, I want them to look at some actual absurd
            patch notes &lpar;like the ones that this generator was based on&rpar; and
            realize that there actually ARE bugs this absurd in real video games,
            and there ARE actual people whose jobs it is to fix these ridiculous
            bugs--and just revel in the absurdity of it all.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            A grammar is defined with simple replacement tokens. A replacer()
            function picks a random replacement for any token that appears in
            the text.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I worked alone on this project. The hardest part was getting
            started; blank canvases are always difficult for me. I was really
            proud of myself when I thought of moving the content of the template
            string into individual fillers. I am very pleased with the final
            result and how absurd the results are while still being completely
            reasonable patch notes.
